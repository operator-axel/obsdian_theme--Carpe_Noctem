# Obsidian_Theme -- Carpe_Noctem

- My first crack at making a theme and working with CSS 
- Will be including simple instructions within CSS to modify any and all icons easily. 
- Add light theme 
- Add full plug-in and mobile support (looks good on my phone! and Andy's Sliding Panes already sipported 

Will be continuing to improve and modify and suggestions are always welcomed.
