# Theme for Obsidian -- "Carpe Noctem"

- My first crack at making a theme and working with CSS 
- Will be including simple instructions within CSS to modify any and all icons easily. 
- Add light theme 
- Add full plug-in and mobile support (looks good on my phone currently and Andy's Sliding Panes already supported)

Will be continuing to improve and modify -- suggestions are always welcomed!
